# IntOverFlow

## Background

I like Data_Structures and Algorithms.

## Install

Run this in your Terminal.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Algo-3F/IntOverFlow/
```

## Usage

Run this in your Terminal.

Maybe it isn't called `main`, you should write the name of that code.

`-static` is an optional parameter, if you don't like it, you can delete it.

```sh
g++ main.cpp -o main -std=c++14 -O2 -static
```

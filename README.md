# IntOverFlow

## Background

I like Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Install

Run this in your Terminal.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Algo-3F/IntOverFlow/
```

## Usage

Run this in your Terminal.

> Maybe some code isn't called `main.cpp`, you should write the name of that code.  
`-O2` and `-static` is optional parameters, if you don't like them, you can delete them.

```sh
g++ main.cpp -o main -std=c++14 -O2 -static
```

Then run the executable file, maybe it's `main.exe` or `main.out` or `main` without extension name.
